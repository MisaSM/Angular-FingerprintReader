This project can be used as a guide on how to implement a DigitalPersona 4500 Fingerprint Reader in a Web Application as well as converting the data received from the reader into an image.

Be careful when carrying out tests or storing said information, Biometrics are important!

Included in this project is the DigitalPersona Websdk under (core/modules/Websdk), however if you're not cloning this repo you will have to implement it yourself.
